This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code") programming challenges. I have implemented my solutions in Python.
## Progress
It is important to mention that I will not be able to participate in the entire Advent of Code, as I unfortunately do not have the time.

I have completed the following years:
- [x] 2022
- [ ] 2023

## Usage
To run the code for a particular day, navigate to the directory for that day and run the Python file. The input for each days challenge is stored in a file named input.txt in the same directory.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements or alternative solutions.
